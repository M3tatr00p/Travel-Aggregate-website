A travel aggregator is a website that finds availabilities and prices of travel offers across many sources and aggregates them all in one place. This helps users find the best prices out of all of the results the aggregator found. That way, it’s easy for consumers to know that they are booking at the lowest price.

Travel aggregator websites are very much like content aggregators, only focused on traveling. They take data from a variety of sources stretching across the internet and place it in one easy-to-access site for visitors to use. Some of these sources can come from airline companies, hotels, and travel agencies, and they all serve to inform the site visitor about anything from plane tickets to upcoming forecasts.

# Bootstrap
Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

# For back-end:
# Flask
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.

 $ pip install -U Flask
# Flask_SQLAlchemy
Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy to your application. It aims to simplify using SQLAlchemy with Flask by providing useful defaults and extra helpers that make it easier to accomplish common tasks.

See the SQLAlchemy documentation to learn how to work with the ORM in depth. The following documentation is a brief overview of the most common tasks, as well as the features specific to Flask-SQLAlchemy.

$ pip install -U Flask-SQLAlchemy.
# Flask_mail
One of the most basic functions in a web application is the ability to send emails to your users. The Flask-Mail extension provides a simple interface to set up SMTP with your Flask application and to send messages from your views and scripts.

 $ pip install Flask-Mail
# About
You’re likely already somewhat familiar with content aggregators in general. They take content from the internet and put it on one site, usually focused around a single topic or subject. This saves visitors from having to go to every individual site about a subject and instead puts everything within reach. Think of it like a hub for a topic that searches the whole internet for the best material related to that topic.

It benefits both the original source and website aggregators. Both will receive traffic, provided the content is good. Some of the most popular content aggregation sites include Popurls, WP News Desk, and Alltop.

Content aggregation is extremely convenient for visitors, and this is where you can capitalize with a well-designed travel aggregator site of your own.
